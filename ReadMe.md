# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Radar Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

The Radar plugin plots data that it finds already open in the wiki in a radial grid with many axis, one for each dimension in the data.
